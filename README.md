Is a mobile application developed for Android platform, which aims to help the teacher in the task of 
accomplishing the task of the school call, in order to automate the process.

In Brazil (where the project's founders reside), although there are mobile solutions for this purpose, 
network infrastructure is still a necessity in many school environments for these solutions to be implemented. 
Many public and private schools in Brazil still do not have enough resources to install wireless Access Points 
that are robust enough to support the number of users simultaneously, or have a reduced amount of bandwidth so 
that all users can use the network in a way server where the applications are hosted on the Internet.

Knowing this, the main idea of the application is to have the teacher scan the nearby mobile devices in order 
to identify the students with the version of the application for the student and with bluetooth connected, 
them in a class. Later the teacher can make an automated call, only choosing the class in which to make the 
call, and the application will wait for the students to confirm with their devices. Confirmation will be made 
by validating the bluetooth MAC address of the student previously registered.
